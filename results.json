It is relevant because it directly addresses the relationship between remote work and sustainability objectives. The retrieval is relevant as the facts contain key terms ('remote work', 'commuting', 'emissions', 'sustainability') matching the query.

Relevant: The answer directly addresses the query by comparing the two documents' retention policies and highlighting their core similarity (five-year period) and implementation difference (start date). 3. Retrieval Relevant: The FACTS contain the key semantic element of a five-year retention period, which is directly related to the QUERY's five-year rule. 4.

While the answer doesn't explicitly mention productivity (a key point in the ground truth), it correctly identifies the core relationship between the documents regarding collaboration mechanisms. 2. Relevant: The answer directly addresses the query's focus on the relationship between remote work policies and collaboration, without introducing unrelated topics. 3. Retrieval Relevant: The facts from Document B contain semantic meaning (structured in-office days for collaboration) directly related to the query's focus on remote work's impact on collaboration. 4. Correct: The answer accurately identifies the relationship as 'supports' based on the shared focus on collaboration through structured remote work policies, even if it doesn't explicitly mention productivity.
