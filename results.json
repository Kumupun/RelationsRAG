It remains relevant by directly addressing the relationship between remote work and sustainability objectives. The retrieval relevance is satisfied as the facts contain key terms ('remote work', 'commuting', 'emissions', 'sustainability') matching the query. The answer is factually correct as it aligns with the ground truth that Document B explicitly supports Document A's claim about remote work reducing commuting-related emissions and contributing to sustainability goals."

Retrieval_relevant: The facts contain direct semantic overlap with the query (remote work, collaboration, structured in-office days). 4. Correctness: While the ground truth references Document 5 (not in provided facts), the answer's reasoning aligns with the stated relationship ('supports') by showing how both documents address collaboration through remote work structures.
