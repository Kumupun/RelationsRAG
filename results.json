It directly addresses the query by comparing retention triggers (collection vs. last interaction) while remaining focused on the core policy similarity. The retrieval_relevance is satisfied because the 5-year retention rule is explicitly mentioned in the facts. Correctness is maintained relative to the provided facts, even though the ground truth introduces an external contradiction (Document 4) not present in the evaluation context.
