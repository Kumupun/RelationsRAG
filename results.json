Retrieval Relevant: The facts contain key terms ('remote work', 'commuting', 'emissions', 'sustainability') matching the query, even though the sustainability office's role is slightly tangential. 4.

It correctly identifies the alignment on retention duration while noting the difference in reference points (collection date vs. last interaction). However, the answer is **not correct** according to the ground truth, which states the relationship contradicts due to Document 4's requirement for indefinite preservation during legal investigations. The answer fails to account for this conflicting information from Document 4, which is part of the ground truth's factual basis. The answer's correctness is therefore invalidated by the ground truth's additional context."
